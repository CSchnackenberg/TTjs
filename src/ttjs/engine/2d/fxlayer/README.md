TTjs - FxLayer
====

A simple 2D API that utilizes 'ttjs/engine/2d/tileRenderer' and easeljs
for scenes created with tile layer and sprites.

Main scenario is using "Tiled Map-Editor" to create retro/simple
2D games.

It supports multiple layertypes (tiles, eseal-stages with sprites,
html content, complex shapes, filling, gradients, etc.).

A simple camera concept allows scrolling including parallax effects.
