TouchThing js - TTjs
====

A JavaScript Entity/Component Game-Framework

This project is the successor of a Android/iOS/Windows game engine we called "TouchThing". This is our approach of a JavaScript Entity/Component engine. 

TTjs main job is to load, manage and update objects in a game context. The implementation is not bound to any specific game engine and it may be used with any 2d/3d graphic engine you like.
